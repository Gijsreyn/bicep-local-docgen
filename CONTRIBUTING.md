## Reporting Issues

Before reporting a new issue, please ensure that the issue was not already reported or

When creating a new issue, please be sure to include a **title and clear description**,
as much relevant information as possible, and, if possible, a test case.

## Sending Pull Requests

Before sending a new pull request, take a look at existing pull requests and issues to
see if the proposed change or fix has been discussed in the past, or if the change was
already implemented but not yet released.

We expect new pull requests to include tests for any affected behavior, and, as we
follow semantic versioning, we may reserve breaking changes until the next major version
release.
